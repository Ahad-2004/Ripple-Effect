# 🌊 Ripple Effect Simulation (Python)

A simple physics-based ripple simulation project made using Python. This project visualizes the ripple effect caused by a droplet falling onto a still water surface. It supports user-defined input angles and displays a visual representation of ripple propagation.

## 📁 Files in Repository

- `ripple21.py`: Core simulation file 
- `ripple22.py`: Updated/improved version with enhanced ripple behavior and UI


## 🚀 Features

- 💧 Simulates a water droplet hitting a surface
- 📐 User can input the angle of the falling droplet
- 🌀 Realistic-looking ripple animation using mathematical functions
- 🖼️ Matplotlib/Pygame/other library for visual output (based on your implementation)

## 🔧 Requirements

Install dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pygame math
import random
(Adjust based on libraries used in your code, e.g., pygame, tkinter, etc.)

▶️ How to Run
Clone this repository:


git clone https://github.com/Ahad-2004/ripple-simulation.git
cd ripple-simulation
Run the simulation:


python ripple22.py
(You can also try ripple21.py if you want the earlier version)

🧠 Concepts Used
Trigonometric wave equations for ripple modeling

2D grid simulation to display ripples

Angle-based drop velocity/direction

Visual animation using plotting or graphics libraries
